Hi, I am Ani Stepanyan. I am making this quick video, so that you can easily learn a little bit about me.

I was born and raised in Armenia. I graduated from the faculty of International Relations at YSU. Currently, I am learning programming as my second profession. That’s why I am attending The RS School front-end course and I am also learning React.js in ACA.

Despite the difficulties, that I met in my way of learning coding, anyway I love programming. When I am coding, I am always learning and challenging myself due to the non-repeating nature of the tasks.

While creating a program or a website, I constantly expand my understanding of the problem, of the solution.

There are so many things to love about programming. For example, when I am sitting behind the screen coding , I get the overwhelming feeling, that I am doing some kind of magic. Actually, it really feel likes being a wizard.

Currently, I am working on Minesweeper game. At first glance, it seemed a little bit tricky. because it’s my first experience of creating games.

In such cases I use Divide and Conquer algorithm, which is a strategy of solving the problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems, then solving the sub-problems, and combining all of them to get the desired result. So, it helps me to concentrate my mind only on one problem, and when I solve it, I go forward to the next one.
